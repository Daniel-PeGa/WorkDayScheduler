# Work Day Scheduler Starter Code

## Project Description

This project will take user input in the form of text for their personal scheduled tasks inside the text containers which change color based on weather or not the time has passed tor their personal tasks to be performed. When the user clicks the save button, the user input will be saved locally so that the user can leave the page, come back, and their schedule is still there.

## Technologies used
* jQuery
* moment
* bootstrap
* local storage

## Future development

I was thinking it could look prettier in mobile devices

## User Story

I WANT to add important events to a daily planner
SO THAT I can manage my time effectively

GIVEN I am using a daily planner to create a schedule

WHEN I view the time blocks for that day
THEN each time block is color-coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future
WHEN I click into a time block
